This repository represents a great many bored minds in search of more meaningful projects.
Because of this it may be fair to assume that many enjoy craft beer, wine, or video games.
I find it odd that so many files are simply named first file.
Perhaps more of a linguistic flair could be added in the future.
After all, anything less is very boring.
